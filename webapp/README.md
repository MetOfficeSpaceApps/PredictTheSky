# Web app for Predict The Sky

At the moment all this does is implement geolocation and reverse geocoding so that we can
work out where the user is, or where they have searched for plus return basic data about the next event.

### Notes

*  When searching for a location, the first hit is used - would be nice to return a list that the user can choose from
*  My date formatting doesn't work properly on mobile

See [http://www.dilkusha.co.uk/PredictTheSky/WhereAmI.html](http://www.dilkusha.co.uk/PredictTheSky/WhereAmI.html) - it isn't very pretty (Yet!)


### Next steps 

*   Make look pretty and format results better
